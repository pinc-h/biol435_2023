# Population Genetics Textbook Problems
A collection of scripts for solving population genetics problems, some problems were taught in BIOL 435. No course material is included. Problems are organized according to their source, mostly G. Coop (2020) and C. C. Li (1955).
Scripts with names that start with "ask_" ask for input, otherwise input must be passed in the command line in a specific order. Each script should have that specified order commented at the top.
